# Different categories of fine-tuning 

1. **Instruction fine-tuning**: Fine tuning the model using instructions included in the prompt to improve its ability to understand and execute tasks described in natural language prompts. It is a generalized model that can do many different things. Needs much larger dataset and compute power to be proficient.

2. **Classification fine-tuning**: Fine-tuning the model to classify text into one of many categories. Example: spam vs not spam. Can only output one of the classes. Can do with smaller dataset and less compute.
